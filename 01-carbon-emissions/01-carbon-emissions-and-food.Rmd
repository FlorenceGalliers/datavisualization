## Introduction

This dataset contains information about 130 countries, their consumption and emissions of 11 types of food.


```{r }
food_consumption <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-18/food_consumption.csv')

# How many countries?
unique(food_consumption$country)
# 130

# How many food categories?
unique(food_consumption$food_category)
# 11

food_consumption$difference <- food_consumption$co2_emmission - food_consumption$consumption

# Biggest differences between consumption and emisisons

tail(sort(food_consumption$difference), 5)
head(sort(food_consumption$difference), 5)

top10 <- food_consumption %>%
  filter(food_consumption$difference >= 989 | food_consumption$difference <= -132)


ggplot(data = top10,
       aes(x = reorder(country, -difference), y = difference)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
